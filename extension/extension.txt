This is achieved in extension: 
allowing users to customize multiple FUNCTIONs and use them in MAIN to achieve modularity. 

It can be shown in the following example:

{
FUNCTION CIRCLE
FUNCTION STAR
}

FUNCTION CIRCLE
{
DO A FROM 1 TO 128 {
  FD 3
  LT 2.8125
  }
}

FUNCTION STAR
{
DO A FROM 1 TO 5 {
  FD 100
  RT 144
  }
}


The first four lines are the MAIN function part, and the next is the definition 
of the function used in the main function.
